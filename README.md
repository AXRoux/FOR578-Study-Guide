TOPICS-1: Cyber Threat Intelligence Fundamentals
Case Study: MOONLIGHT MAZE

Moonlight Maze was an early cyber espionage campaign targeting US military and academic institutions in the late 1990s. It was attributed to the Russian government and is one of the first significant state-sponsored cyber attacks in history.
Understanding Intelligence

Intelligence is the process of collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information about a specific subject. In the context of cybersecurity, intelligence focuses on identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential cyber threats.
Case Study: Operation Aurora

Operation Aurora was a series of cyber attacks targeting Google and other prominent US companies in 2009. The attackers, believed to be state-sponsored and originating from China, targeted intellectual property and sensitive information.
Understanding Cyber Threat Intelligence

Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is a discipline within cybersecurity that focuses on collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information about cyber threats to support decision-making and improve an organization's security posture.
Threat Intelligence Consumption

Threat Intelligence Consumption is the process of gathering, organizing, and using information about cyber threats to inform decision-making and enhance an organization's security posture.
Positioning the Team to Generate Intelligence

To generate intelligence effectively, organizations need to position their teams appropriately by assigning roles and responsibilities, implementing collaboration mechanisms, and providing access to relevant tools and resources.
Planning and Direction

Planning and direction involve setting intelligence goals and objectives, developing an intelligence cycle, and establishing a framework for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence.
TOPICS-2: Intrusion Analysis and Kill Chains
Primary Collection Source: Intrusion Analysis

Intrusion analysis is the process of identifying, investigating, and understanding cyber threats by analyzing the tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers during an intrusion.
Kill Chain Courses of Action

Courses of action in the Kill Chain framework involve detecting, analyzing, and responding to cyber threats at various stages of an attack to disrupt or mitigate their impact.
Kill Chain Deep Dive

A deep dive into the Kill Chain framework involves a comprehensive examination of each stage of the attack process and how organizations can defend against or mitigate threats at each stage.
Handling Multiple Kill Chains

Handling multiple kill chains requires organizations to develop comprehensive security strategies that address multiple attack vectors and stages, and prioritize resources and actions based on risk assessment.
TOPICS-3: Advanced Collection Sources and Case Studies
Case Study: HEXANE

HEXANE is a threat actor group believed to be originating from Iran, targeting industrial control systems (ICS) in the Middle East. The group uses spear-phishing campaigns and custom malware to compromise networks.
Collection Source: Malware

Malware analysis is the process of examining and understanding malicious software to identify its purpose, functionality, and potential impact on a target system.
Collection Source: Domains

Domain analysis involves investigating and monitoring domain registration data, DNS records, and other related information to identify malicious or suspicious activity.
Case Study: GlassRAT

GlassRAT is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) attributed to a Chinese threat actor group. It is known for its stealthy operation and has been used in targeted attacks against organizations in various sectors.
Collection Source: External Datasets

External datasets include various sources of information, such as vulnerability databases, threat
