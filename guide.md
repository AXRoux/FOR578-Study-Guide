Operation Aurora was a series of targeted cyber-attacks launched in 2009 by Chinese threat actors, primarily targeting Google and other major US technology companies. The campaign exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Internet Explorer to gain access to corporate networks and steal intellectual property.
Understanding Cyber Threat Intelligence
Overview

Cyber threat intelligence is the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information about cyber threats, helping organizations understand and mitigate risks posed by threat actors.
Key Concepts

    Cyber threat intelligence sources: open-source, commercial, and internal
    Cyber threat intelligence frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK, Cyber Kill Chain, Diamond Model
    Integrating cyber threat intelligence into security operations

Threat Intelligence Consumption
Overview

Threat intelligence consumption is the process of acquiring, integrating, and applying threat intelligence to improve an organization's security posture.
Key Concepts

    Intelligence requirements: identifying the organization's specific needs for threat intelligence
    Intelligence sharing: participating in information sharing communities and leveraging shared intelligence
    Intelligence automation: incorporating threat intelligence into security tools and processes

Positioning the Team to Generate Intelligence
Overview

To effectively generate intelligence, an organization must establish a dedicated team with the right skills, tools, and processes.
Key Concepts

    Building a threat intelligence team: roles, responsibilities, and skill sets
    Threat intelligence tools and technologies: SIEM, TIP, threat hunting platforms
    Creating effective processes and workflows for intelligence generation

Planning and Direction
Overview

Planning and direction are the first steps in the intelligence cycle, involving the identification of intelligence requirements, resource allocation, and establishing priorities.
Key Concepts

    Defining intelligence requirements: identifying the organization's specific needs for threat intelligence
    Prioritizing intelligence requirements: balancing resources and focusing on high-impact threats
    Communicating intelligence requirements: ensuring that the team understands and aligns with organizational priorities

TOPIC-2: Primary Collection Source: Intrusion Analysis; Kill Chain Courses of Action; Kill Chain Deep Dive; Handling Multiple Kill Chains
Primary Collection Source: Intrusion Analysis
Overview

Intrusion analysis is the process of examining security incidents and intrusions to understand the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors. Intrusion analysis is a primary source of information for cyber threat intelligence.
Key Concepts

    Incident response process: identification, containment, eradication, recovery, lessons learned
    Analyzing intrusion artifacts: log data, network traffic, malware samples
    Identifying patterns, similarities, and differences between intrusions

Kill Chain Courses of Action
Overview

The Cyber Kill Chain is a framework used to describe the phases of a cyber attack. Courses of action (COAs) are proactive and reactive measures that organizations can take at each phase of the kill chain to detect, prevent, or mitigate attacks.
Key Concepts

    Understanding the Cyber Kill Chain phases: reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, actions on objectives
    Proactive and reactive COAs for each phase
    Prioritizing COAs based on risk, impact, and feasibility

Kill Chain Deep Dive
Overview

A deep dive into the Cyber Kill Chain framework provides a comprehensive understanding of the attacker's methodology and helps organizations identify gaps in their security posture.
Key Concepts

    In-depth analysis of each phase of the Cyber Kill Chain
    Common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors at each phase
    Identifying and addressing security gaps in the organization's defenses

Handling Multiple Kill Chains
Overview

Threat actors often employ multiple kill chains in a single campaign or operation. Handling multiple kill chains requires an understanding of the relationships between them and the ability to prioritize resources and defenses.
Key Concepts

    Identifying relationships between kill chains: shared infrastructure, TTPs, objectives
    Prioritizing defenses based on the criticality of assets, the severity of threats, and the potential impact of attacks
    Coordinating responses to multiple kill chains to minimize risk and optimize resource utilization

TOPIC-3: Case Study: HEXANE; Collection Source: Malware; Collection Source: Domains; Case Study: GlassRAT; Collection Source: External Datasets; Collection Source: TLS Certificates; Case Study: Trickbots
Case Study: HEXANE
Overview

HEXANE is a cyber-espionage group that targets organizations in the oil, gas, and telecommunications sectors, primarily in the Middle East. The group has been active since at least 2017 and is known for using custom malware in their attacks. Their campaigns focus on reconnaissance, intelligence gathering, and persistence within targeted networks.

    Identifying patterns, similarities, and differences between malware samples
    Understanding malware's capabilities and objectives

Collection Source: Domains
Overview

Domain data can provide valuable context about the infrastructure used by threat actors, their operational patterns, and relationships between different campaigns. Examining domain data can help identify malicious domains, infrastructure overlaps, and potential links between different threat actors.
