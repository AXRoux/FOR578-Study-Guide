Case Study: HEXANE
Overview

HEXANE is a cyber-espionage group that targets organizations in the oil, gas, and telecommunications sectors, primarily in the Middle East. The group has been active since at least 2017 and is known for using custom malware in their attacks. Their campaigns focus on reconnaissance, intelligence gathering, and persistence within targeted networks.
Collection Source: Malware
Overview

Malware is a primary method used by threat actors to infiltrate networks, steal data, and cause disruption. Analyzing malware provides valuable insights into the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors.
Key Concepts

    Malware analysis techniques: static, dynamic, and behavioral analysis
    Identifying patterns, similarities, and differences between malware samples
    Understanding malware's capabilities and objectives

Collection Source: Domains
Overview

Domain data can provide valuable context about the infrastructure used by threat actors, their operational patterns, and relationships between different campaigns. Examining domain data can help identify malicious domains, infrastructure overlaps, and potential links between different threat actors.
Key Concepts

    Domain registration data: WHOIS, registration dates, registrant information
    Domain resolution data: IP addresses, historical DNS records, associated subdomains
    Detecting patterns and anomalies in domain data

Case Study: GlassRAT
Overview

GlassRAT is a remote access Trojan (RAT) used by a Chinese cyber-espionage group known as APT15. GlassRAT was first identified in 2015, targeting government and commercial organizations in Southeast Asia. The malware's stealthy capabilities, unique features, and sophisticated techniques made it particularly effective in evading detection and maintaining persistence.
Collection Source: External Datasets
Overview

External datasets can provide valuable context and additional data points to support cyber threat intelligence. These datasets may include vulnerability databases, threat intelligence feeds, or data from other security companies and researchers.
Key Concepts

    Understanding the value of external datasets in enriching intelligence
    Leveraging open-source and commercial data sources
    Integrating external data into the intelligence lifecycle

Collection Source: TLS Certificates
Overview

TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificates are used to secure and authenticate network communications. Analyzing TLS certificates can provide insights into the infrastructure used by threat actors, their operational patterns, and possible relationships between different campaigns.
Key Concepts

    Identifying patterns and anomalies in TLS certificates
    Understanding the relationships between TLS certificates and malicious domains
    Leveraging tools and resources for TLS certificate analysis

Case Study: Trickbots
Overview

Trickbot is a modular banking Trojan that has been active since 2016. Initially targeting financial institutions, Trickbot has evolved to include capabilities such as lateral movement, data exfiltration, and ransomware deployment. It is known for its frequent updates, versatile modules, and ability to adapt to different environments.
Key Concepts

    Evolution of Trickbot's capabilities and targets
    Understanding the infrastructure and distribution methods used by Trickbot
    Analyzing Trickbot's modules and their functionality
